                We support underrepresented entrepreneurs to imagine, launch and grow sustainable and impactful businesses through tailored support, community and partnerships.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since 2010, we have pioneered a unique approach to entrepreneurship support activities, utilising a mix of exclusive events, peer support, hands-on seminars and 1-2-1 skilled support to level the playing field and ensure all entrepreneurs, whatever their background, are given the chance to make their mark.
            </p>
            <p>
                Business start-ups are key to job and wealth creation, and through the work of the NU Start’s enterprise programme, people across the country are being empowered to establish new ventures every day.
            </p>
            <p>
                We enable entrepreneurs who are running their businesses as sole proprietors, empowering young people to set up and run student companies under the guidance of a business volunteer. Young people make all the decisions about their business, from deciding on the company name, managing the company finances and selling to the public.<!-- Participants gain practical business experience and key skills. Participants gain the practical business experience, adaptability, entrepreneurial mindset and employability skills needed to secure successful futures.-->

            </p>
            <!--<p>
                Step-by-step guidance is available through our dedicated online platform, which has videos and resources to support students to run their company. All this takes place with the support of a Business Adviser who supports student companies virtually through our fully moderated mentoring platform. Students will also be supported in person (where this is possible). All Business Advisers are DBS checked and have completed safeguarding training.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our company initiatives support students to gain confidence, practical know-how and attributes to prepare for the world of work. By taking part in an online self-assessment, students will also receive a certificate to evidence the skills they have developed throughout the programme.
