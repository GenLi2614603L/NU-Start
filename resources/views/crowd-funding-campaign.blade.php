      <p>
          The Money Management programme is devised to teach learners the basics of personal budgeting, how to spend money wisely and how to avoid impulsive and compulsive spending. Accurate budgeting will enable learners to cut unnecessary expenses, save money, plan and invest for the future.
      </p>
      <p>
          This ten week programme will support young people (16-25) who are not in employment, education or training (NEET), to increase social connections with new people through working together, peer mentoring, and build vocational and mental health resilience skills to reach their full potential.
      </p>
      <p>
          Participants will receive a certificate upon successfully completing the workshops. Opportunities to go onto further education and gain a recognised qualification will be available.
