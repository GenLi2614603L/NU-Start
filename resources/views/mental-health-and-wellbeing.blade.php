                We believe that people with mental health issues have the right and the abilities to lead independent, fulfilling lives as part of their communities. The people who use our services are at the heart of everything we do. They influence and shape the support they receive from us, and the way our services are run. These core beliefs underpin the vision, mission and values we aspire to.
            </p>
            <p>
                We understand that everyone who seeks our support is different and their needs are individual to them. We believe in enabling people to lead their own recovery at their own pace by supporting their decisions about the care they receive.
            </p>
            <p>
                We offer a wide variety of support to help people deal with the personal and practical impacts of mental health issues. The services we can provide range from one-to-one support in the community to supported accommodation and making sure people understand and are able to express their needs in their dealings with official bodies.
            </p>

                At NU Start, it’s our people who make us what we are, from the people who use our services to our project staff all over the country and our board of trustees and management team. We all understand the need to focus on the people who use our services and their recovery from mental distress, which is why we look to empower them to lead on the decisions around the support they receive and value their lived experience.
