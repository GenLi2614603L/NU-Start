                Today's job market has become increasingly more difficult to navigate. We support young people to gain the skills they need to enter the world of work.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our Employment Training and Skills (ETS) courses provide young people with skills and qualifications they can build on and develop throughout their working life.
            </p>
            <p>
                Young people with higher education qualifications and skilled trades are struggling to keep up the pace with technology and shifts in demanded skills.
            </p>
            <p>
                We believe that one's employment should meet more than their basic needs, rather it should allow them to access a wage that allows them to live a full life, and provide benefits that protect them, and their families, from life's many challenges. We have spent years refining jobs and workforce initiatives that provide the hands-on support that people need to succeed. Each initiative meets the needs of different populations with a focus on assessing where they are, and where they want to go. <!--In partnership with employers, schools, colleges and organisations, we trained and supported over 1,000 young people every year through 20 specialist services. We provide courses, support and careers advice.-->
            </p>
            <!--<p>
                If you're a young person looking to enter employment, we work with you on an individual basis to find the best training and employment opportunities in your area. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Once you are in training or work, we give you ongoing support to make sure it's all working out for you. From help with application forms to interview techniques, NU Start is there to offer support every step of the way. As well as providing specific qualifications, employability skills, and career advice and guidance, we also offer apprenticeships programmes.
